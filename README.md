# Nhentai-Shortcut!

Have you ever have a this kind of problem? Someone put a weird number or id on internet.
You know what it is but it require you to complete 4-5 steps to go that place.

So I decide to create this side project. You just bookmark it or add it to your phone homepage, then insert the code. JUST THAT!

## To-do list

- Support PWA!!! <- I need this so much. I want to install it on my phone.
- Add more design to the UI.
- Implementing style/UI frameworks. (Choices in my mind are Styled-Component, Material UI, Tailwind, etc.)
- Dynamic path shortcut in order to support other websites and allow users to select default website.
- Bookmark feature
- etc...
